7-6: Ergonomic light switches; can every switch see a unique light switch, not blocked by wall
-Issue: 1:1 switch:light
-Make wall block = weight>1?
-max flow, where:
	-edges = every light to every switch
		-capacity = 1 if no blocking wall/visible, cap = 0 if blocked/not visible
	-check overall capacity = n (# lights and also # switches), apply flow algorithm
		-TODO check won't be redundant, run time
-Alt: Circulations, switchs = sources, lights = sinks, edges same as ^
