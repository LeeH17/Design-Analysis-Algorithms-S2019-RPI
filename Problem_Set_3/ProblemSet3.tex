\begin{Question} (6.5) String Segmentation (Segmented Least Squares Fit? As from class.)
\end{Question}

\noindent Given: Given a string of letters $y = y_1 y_2 ... y_n$ with a length of $n$. We can assume we can get the quality of any string using the function $quality(x)$ for string x. Total quality of a segmentation is the qualities of each of its blocks.\\

\noindent Find: Find an efficient algorithm the gets the segmentation of maximum total quality. \\

\begin{Algorithm}
Find the optimal string segmentation.
\end{Algorithm}

\begin{proof}
\begin{description}

\underline{Subproblems:} $OPT(j)$, is the total quality of the optimal segmenation from character 1 to character $j$. $Segment(i, j)$ is the segmentation from $i$ to $j$.

\underline{Recurrence:} $OPT(j) = max \{OPT(i) + quality(Segment(i+1, j))$ for all $i$ from 1 to $j-1$

This is similar to the answer for Segmented Least Squares Fit, as discussed in lecture. The main change needed is to replace the error function with the quality function in this problem and to maximize quality rather than minimize error.

\underline{Full Algorithm:}

$OPT(1) = quality(x_1)$    \quad // Base Case

$segmentations = [[1]]$	 \quad // List of list of segmentation break points for each $OPT(j)$

for j = 2, j $\leq$ n, j++

	\quad currentQuality = $quality(Segment(1, j)$

	\quad currentSegmentation = 1

	\quad for i = 2, i < j, i++ \quad // Find $OPT(j)$

	\quad \quad if $OPT(i)$ + $quality(Segment(i+1, j) \geq$  currentQuality

	\quad \quad \quad currentQuality = $OPT(i)$ + $quality(Segment(i+1, j)$

	\quad \quad \quad currentSegmentation = i

	\quad $OPT(j)$ = currentQuality

	\quad $segmentations[j] = segmentations[i] + currentSegmentation$

$return$ $OPT[n], segmentations$

\underline{Running Time:} $O(n^2)$. Each character is compared to the $OPT$ values of all prior characters.

\end{description}
\end{proof}

\begin{Question} (6.28) Scheduling ((un-)Weighted Interval Scheduling? Lecture 25Jan2019; nope, nvm. Job start times can be defined. More like knapsack then? Except limitations by deadline, added parameter to knapsack's size limits)
\end{Question}
\noindent Given: You have $n$ weeks and $s_i$ parts to be produced each of those weeks. You must decide between two shipping companies, Company A which charges $r * s$ to ship in a given week while Company B charges $c$ each week in blocks of four consecutive weeks.\\

\noindent Find: A schedule deciding between company A or B for each of those $n$ weeks while following company B's restrictions. Cost is the amount paid in shipping costs. \\

\noindent Give a polynomial time algorithm that takes a sequence of supply values, $s_1, s_2, \ldots , s_n$ and returns a schedule of minimum cost.

\begin{Algorithm}
Find the optimal schedule.
\end{Algorithm}

\begin{proof}
\begin{description}

Subproblems: $OPT(j)$, or the optimal schedule from week 0 to week $j$. This can be expanded from week 4 to week n.

Recurrence: $OPT(j) = min \{\stackanchor{$r * s_j + OPT(j-1)$}{$4 * c + OPT(j-4)$}$, where $OPT(j)$ represents the optimal shipping costs possible from week 0 to week $j$. $r, s,$ and $c$ are as defined in the problem, referring to company A's cost per weight unit, total weight during week $j$, and company B's cost per week respectively.

Full Algorithm: 

OPT[0, 1, 2, 3] = [0, $s_1 * r, s_1*r + s_2 * r, s_1*r + s_2*r + s_3*r$]

for j = 0, j $\leq$ n, j++

	\quad if $OPT[j - 4] + 4*c < OPT[j-1] + r*s_j$

	\quad \quad 	$OPT[j] = OPT[j-4] + 4 * c$

	\quad else:

	\quad \quad  $OPT[j] = OPT[j-1] + r*s_j$

$return OPT[n]$

Running Time: $O(n)$. Each week is traversed once, while two already calculated $OPT(j)$s are accessed, $OPT(j-1)$ and $OPT(j-4)$, each week.

\end{description}
\end{proof}
